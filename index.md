I am a PhD student in psycholinguistics at <a href="https://bloomington.iu.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana University Bloomington</a>. My research interests are sentence and word processing using experimental (reaction time, accuracy, eye-tracking) and neuroimaging (EEG) methods.

I focus on how syntactic, semantic and prosodic information can be integrated in sentence comprehension. I am also interested in written word recognition and orthographic processing in Chinese. 

I work closely with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chienjerlin/home" target="_blank">Dr. Chien-Jer Charles Lin</a> in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/language-and-cognition/home" target="_blank">Language and Cognition Lab</a>.
