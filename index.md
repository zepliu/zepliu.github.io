I am a PhD student in psycholinguistics at <a href="https://bloomington.iu.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana University Bloomington (IUB)</a>. 

My research broadly explores the relationship between language and cognition, with specific interests in psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, and language processing and learning. To investigate these topics, I use a range of experimental methods—including reaction time, accuracy, and eye-tracking measures—alongside neuroimaging techniques such as EEG.

Within this broad framework, my work centers on three main areas: 1) Understanding how individuals use linguistic cues–such as syntax, semantics, and prosody–to resolve structural ambiguities during sentence processing; 2) Leveraging recent advances in Large Language Models to gain insights into and simulate human syntactic processing; and 3) investigating written word recognition and orthographic processing in Chinese. 

At IUB, I work closely with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chienjerlin/home" target="_blank">Dr. Chien-Jer Charles Lin</a> in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/language-and-cognition/home" target="_blank">Language and Cognition Lab</a>. I also collaborate with Dr. Bonnie Nozari in the <a href="https://www.nozarilab.com" target="_blank">Language Production and Executive Control Lab</a>. In addition, I work with <a href="https://brain.bnu.edu.cn/English/Faculty/CurrentFaculty/Gzz/d7ea1219c8074270bba5c736af040ba7.htm" target="_blank">Dr. Taomei Guo</a> at Beijing Normal University on research related to children's orthographic processing.
