I am a PhD student in psycholinguistics at <a href="https://bloomington.iu.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana University Bloomington</a>. My research interests are sentence and word processing using experimental (reaction time, accuracy, eye-tracking) and neuroimaging (EEG) methods.

<span style="font-size:18px"> 
I focus on how syntactic, semantic and prosodic information can be integrated in sentence comprehension. I am also interested in written word recognition and orthographic processing in Chinese.

I work closely with [Dr. Chien-Jer Charles Lin](https://sites.google.com/view/chienjerlin/home) in the [Language and Cognition Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/language-and-cognition/home).
