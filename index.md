I am a PhD student at Indiana University Bloomington. I'm interested in psycholinguistics.

My research broadly explores the relationship between language and cognition, with specific interests in sentence & word processing and language learning. Within this broad framework, my work centers on three main areas: 1) Understanding how individuals use linguistic cues–such as syntax, semantics, and prosody–to resolve structural ambiguities during sentence processing; 2) Leveraging recent advances in Large Language Models to gain insights into and simulate human syntactic processing; and 3) investigating written word recognition and orthographic processing in Chinese. 

At Indiana University, I work closely with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chienjerlin/home" target="_blank">Dr. Chien-Jer Charles Lin</a> in the Language and Cognition Lab. I also collaborate with <a href="https://www.nozarilab.com/bonnie" target="_blank">Dr. Bonnie Nozari</a> in the Language Production and Executive Control Lab. In addition, I work with <a href="https://brain.bnu.edu.cn/English/Faculty/CurrentFaculty/Gzz/d7ea1219c8074270bba5c736af040ba7.htm" target="_blank">Dr. Taomei Guo</a> at Beijing Normal University on research related to children's orthographic processing.
