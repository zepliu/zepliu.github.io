### 1. Syntactic ambiguity resolution

In this line of research, I am interested in how people use linguistic cues to resolve structural ambiguities and how their syntactic representations adapt through exposure.

### 2. Orthographic processing

This topic concerns written word recognition and orthographic processing in Chinese.
