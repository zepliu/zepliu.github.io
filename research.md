### 1. Ambiguity resolution

In this line of research, I am interested in how people make use of syntactic, semantic and prosodic cues to resolve ambiguities and how they align their interpretations in response to repeated exposure in sentence processing.

### 2. Orthographic processing

This topic concerns written word recognition and orthographic processing in Chinese.
