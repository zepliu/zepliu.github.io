### 1. Syntactic ambiguity resolution

In this line of research, I am interested in how people make use of syntactic, semantic and prosodic cues to resolve structural ambiguities and how they align their interpretations in response to repeated exposure to the intented interpretation in sentence processing.

### 2. Orthographic processing

This topic concerns written word recognition and orthographic processing in Chinese.
