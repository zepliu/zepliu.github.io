### 1. Syntactic Adaptation

In this line of research, I am intersted in how people make use of linguistic and non-linguistic information to adapt their syntactic expectation during online processing.

- Liu, Z. & Lin, C. J. C. (2023). Greater prediction error does not lead to better syntactic adaptation: Evidence from Chinese ambiguity resolution. Poster presented at *the 29th Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing*(AMLaP-2023), Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain, August 31-September 2. [Download poster](https://zepliu.github.io/assets/pdf/AMLaP23.pdf)

- Liu, Z. & Lin, C. J. C. (In preparation). The role of grammar in syntactic adaptations of Chinese: The state of the art . *Handbook of Chinese Language Learning and Technology*.

- Liu, Z. & Lin, C. J. C. (2022). Adaptation effects in sentence ambiguity resolution revisited. Poster presented at *the 35th Annual Conference on Human Sentence Processing*, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, March 24-26 (Virtual).

### 2. Orthographic Processing

I am also interested in Chinese word recognition and orthographic processing, mostly in typically developing children. 

- Zhang, M.*, Liu, Z.*, Botezatu, M.R., Dang, Q., Yuan, Q., Han, J., Liu, L, & Guo, T. (2023). A large-scale database of Chinese characters and words collected from elementary school textbooks. *Behavior Research Method*. (* denotes equal contribution)

- Zhang, Z., Yuan, Q., Liu, Z., Zhang, M., Wu, J., Lu, C., Ding, G., & Guo, T. (2021). The cortical organization of writing sequence: evidence from observing Chinese characters in motion. *Brain Structure and Function*, 1-13.
