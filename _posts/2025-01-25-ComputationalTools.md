### 1.Surprisal in Large Language Models
- [A unified interface for computing surprisal from language models](https://github.com/aalok-sathe/surprisal)
- [Tools for calculating psycholinguistically-relevant metrics of language statistics using transformer language models](https://github.com/jmichaelov/PsychFormers)

Check [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X24000135) for a large-scale dataset on using LLMs surprisal to explain syntactic disambiguation difficulty: [Syntactic Ambiguity Processing Benchmark](https://github.com/caplabnyu/sapbenchmark)

### 2. Model traninig 
- [Tutorials and resources on LLMs training and evaluation](https://sarehalli.github.io/resources) from Professor Suhas Arehalli
