In psycholinguistic research, various paradigms are used to investigate the mechanisms underlying langauge processing. Once a paradigm is chosen, the next step is to design materials and conduct experiments.

Paradigms (keep updating)
- [A-maze paradigm](https://vboyce.github.io/Maze/) for measuring incremental difficulty in sentence processing, see the [original paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X19301147)

When materials involve images, this can be helpful: [Pictures for experimental tasks](https://www.irasutoya.com). For audio stimuli, this [tutorials and praat script](https://www.ddaidone.com/praat-scripts.html) from Professor Danielle Daidone can be helpful for sound synthesis and manipulation. 

When stimuli are ready to go, [Pavlovia.org](https://www.psychopy.org/online/usingPavlovia.html) is a good platform for data collection.
