In psycholinguistic research, various paradigms are used to investigate the mechanisms underlying langauge processing. Once a paradigm is chosen, the next step is to design materials and conduct experiments.

#### 1. Paradigms 
- [A-maze paradigm](https://vboyce.github.io/Maze/) for measuring incremental difficulty in sentence processing, see the [original paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X19301147)
